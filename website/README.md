## Website Summary
This builds off of a basic [Start Boostrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/) template.

It's a static website hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket.


## Run Locally
In your terminal under this root website folder type: `open -a "Google Chrome" index.html` to open up the index page on your local host.

## Edit
The only files you should be changing are inside `css/style.css`. This is just all of the CSS overwrites.

The entire file is under "index.html".

Add any screenshots / images into the /images folder.
