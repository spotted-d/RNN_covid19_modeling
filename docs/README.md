## Website Summary
This website is served using Github pages.
It builds off of a basic [Start Boostrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/) template.


## Run Locally
In your terminal under this root website folder type: `open -a "Google Chrome" index.html` to open up the index page on your local host. You can just refresh the page to see any changes you make to the site.

## Make Changes
All of the written content is under `index.html`. Add content there.

The `css/style.css` file contains all of the custom overwrites to the starter template.

Add any screenshots or images into the `images` folder.
